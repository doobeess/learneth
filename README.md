# learneth
A tool to help you memorize text, word for word. Written in Python.

### A fair warning

This branch is highly experimental. Do not attempt to try using it.
Once the branch is stable, it will be merged with Main.

## What's different?

Instead of clearing the screen every time it adds another word, this will attempt to draw a single word and position the cursor to draw the next.

The executables here will be for the stable version, not the optimized version. This will change when the optimized version becomes stable.
